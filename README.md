## Strategic Considerations

### Valuation Justification

* The corrected \$418.3 million PV of synergies provides **limited support** for current valuation premiums.
* Achieving integration benefits, particularly cost efficiencies and tech leverage, is essential to delivering value.

### Key Risks

* Integration complexity (especially technology & servicing platforms)
* Regulatory hurdles and antitrust scrutiny
* Macroeconomic volatility, notably interest rate sensitivity

---

## Conclusion

The proposed merger could yield \$500 million in annual synergies, with a **present value of approximately \$418.3 million** after correcting for discounted realization timing. While the EBITDA uplift of 27.59% is meaningful, the modest synergy NPV—relative to a \$52.87 billion combined enterprise value—means this deal’s strategic success **hinges on flawless execution**. Premium valuations currently embedded in both stocks demand delivery, or the deal risks value destruction.
