## Strategic Considerations

### Valuation Justification

* The estimated \$500 million in annual synergies helps support Mr. Cooper’s and Rocket’s above-average EV/EBITDA multiples.
* Realizing cost efficiencies and leveraging Rocket’s fintech platform are critical to achieving financial and operational integration.

### Risks

* Integration complexity, especially between technology platforms and servicing operations
* Regulatory approvals and compliance
* Macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly interest rate fluctuations

## Conclusion

The proposed merger could yield \$500 million in annual synergies, with a present value of approximately \$776.2 million. These synergies, if realized, would enhance the combined EBITDA by 27.59% and help justify the significant valuation premiums observed in both firms. The strategic rationale is strong, but execution and integration will be key to unlocking this value.
